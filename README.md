#####
### Welcome!
This repository contains the results of the Google Data Analytics Prefessional Certification Capstone.  
  
The case study was made for a fictitious bike share company (Cyclistic) located in Chicago. The director of marketing 
believes the company‚Äôs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the main goal 
is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.  
  
I used the previous 12 months of [Cyclistic trip historical data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) 
to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under 
[this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
  
  
### Full Documentation:
The [Capstone Documentation PDF](CapstoneDocumentation.pdf) is a file that has all the steps of the analysis process.  
  
  
### Case Study Presentation:
The [Case Study Result Presentation PPTX](CaseStudyResultPresentation.pptx) is a presentation with the main topics of the result of the analysis process.  
  
  
### The Code:
All Python codes are in the [main.py](main.py) file.  
  
  
### Other Files:
The [Chicago Interactive Map HTML](chicago_interactive_map.html) is an interactive map that shows the main used stations by user type (casual end member).  
The [Data](Data) folder has other files such as the downloaded '.csv' files and the graphs produced for the analyses.
